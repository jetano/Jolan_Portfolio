## [Titanic Survival EDA](https://github.com/jetano/TitanicEDA)

This project highlights the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of survival using the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

Highlights:
* Social class of passenger was significant in survival index. Wealthier passengers (i.e., those who had class 1 tickets) had higher survival than those who had class 3 tickets. This finding is consistent with both male and female passengers. In terms of gender, female passengers had higher survival than male.

* The correlation heatmap of numerical variables revealed significant correlation between Fare and Survival.

* Survival curve of the passenger age showed peak distributions between ages 0-5 and 20-35.

## [Annealing Time Plots of Different Gel Formulas](https://github.com/jetano/annealing_decay)

This project is about the relationship of the annealing time versus the absorbance values of irradiated chemical dosimeters. Here, Sol. A, B, and C refer to the dosimeters with varying reagent concentrations that were exposed to ionizing radiation. The irradiation of each dosimeter was performed in increasing time intervals (i.e., 0 to 120 minutes of irradiation). After irradition, the dosimeters were exposed to heat (annealing) at specific time intervals (i.e., 0 to 96 hours) and were measured using a spectrometer to obtain the absorbance values.

The measured absorbance values were then imported to Python for analysis and visualization. Here, I used numpy, pandas, and SciPy libraries for data manipulation and curve fitting. Then, I used matplotlib for data visualization.
