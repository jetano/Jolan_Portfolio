# Project 1: Annealing Time Plots of Different Gel Formulas

This project is about the relationship of the annealing time versus the absorbance values of irradiated chemical dosimeters. Here, Sol. A, B, and C refer to the dosimeters with varying reagent concentrations that were exposed to ionizing radiation. The irradiation of each dosimeter was performed in increasing time intervals (i.e., 0 to 120 minutes of irradiation). After irradition, the dosimeters were exposed to heat (annealing) at specific time intervals (i.e., 0 to 96 hours) and were measured using a spectrometer to obtain the absorbance values.

The measured absorbance values were then imported to Python for analysis and visualization. Here, I used numpy, pandas, and SciPy libraries for data manipulation and curve fitting. Then, I used matplotlib for data visualization.
